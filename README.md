The pomodoro technique is a time management method that can be applied to various tasks, either in studies or at work.

The concept of pomodoro is that the person who studies or performs a task takes exactly 25 minutes. Concluding it or not, it should stop and rest 5 minutes. After rest, another 25-minute work cycle starts again.
